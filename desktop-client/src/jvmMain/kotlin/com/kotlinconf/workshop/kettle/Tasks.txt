Task 1. Implement KettleService.observeTemperature
Task 2. Complete implementation of observeKettleState (starting code receives one element)
Task 3. Implement KettleViewModel.fahrenheitTemperature (+ add 'shareIn' to celsiusTemperature!)
Task/LiveDemo. Implement StateFlow
Task.
1. Change ALLOW_UNSTABLE_NETWORK to true. Click on "unstable network" and make sure the app crashes!
2. Change the scope in KettleViewModel to use SupervisorJob and the provided coroutineExceptionHandler
See what happens now - only the flow crashes, the app stays responsive (despite not working properly).
We have the error information in the log.
3. Fix getTemperature flow properly to emit nulls if there's no value.
